# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is an Obsidian vault for personal knowledge management (PKM), not a code project.

## Folder Structure (PARA Method)

- **1. Projects** - Active projects with clear goals and deadlines
- **2. Areas** - Ongoing areas of responsibility (no end date)
- **3. Resources** - Topics of interest, reference materials
- **4. Archives** - Inactive items from the above categories

## Working with This Vault

- All notes are written in Markdown
- Use `[[wikilinks]]` for internal links between notes
- Respect the PARA folder hierarchy when creating or moving notes
- The `.obsidian` folder contains vault configuration (plugins, themes, settings)
